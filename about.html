<center><B>Hello and welcome to Ethereality Designs! Here I believe that if you can dream it, you can do it.</B></center><BR>
My name is Autumn and I am just your average girl. I started Ethereality Designs with the hopes that I could help people achieve their dreams. Whether you are a small business owner, or starting out with creating your own thing! No matter what it is I am here for you.<BR>
<center><B>A little about me:</B></center><BR>
I am a thirty year old, married, mom of two. I am currently halfway through a computer science degree and I love every second of it. When I have free time I often design, write or bake. Although somedays, I do get lucky and I can play my favorite games. Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing definitely my top two right now!<BR>
I have been designing graphics and coding websites since I was fourteen years old. (hello neopets!) It's always been a fun way to express myself.<BR>
I always feel that a design can be improved upon in one way or another. With that said, I will work tirelessly to make something that you've always dreamed of. Lets work together to create something beautiful.
